# IO â€“ A Model for Compositional Communication

_Work in progress_

Simple, secure and composable abstraction for efficient stream processing in a purely functional fashion.

This library implements flow-based programming primitives for data processing. An application can be viewed as a network of asynchronous processes, called _nodes_, communicating by means of streams of structured data chunks.

The communication between nodes is described in the following diagram:

```
          Upstream       |     Downstream


      +-------------+        +-------------+
      |             |        |             |
...  <--           <--  req  <--           <--  ...
      |    node0    |        |    node1    |
...  -->           -->  rep  -->           -->  ...
      |             |        |             |
      +-------------+        +-------------+
```


### Features

- Simple and extensible core.
- First-class composable computations.
- Bidirectional flow of data.
- Backend agnostic processing (sources and sinks may be data-structures, sockets, files, etc).
- Support for various kinds of communication patterns (`pair`, `reqrep`, `pubsub`, etc).
- Prompt finalization of resources.
- Early termination by downstream and notification of uptream termination.

## Examples

```ocaml

(* Produces a stream of integers from `start` to `stop. *)
let rec range start stop =
  count => take stop => drop start
  
(* Applies a function to each element of a stream. *)
let rec map f =
  forever (await >>= yield)

(* Filters values of a stream using a predicate. *)
let rec filter pred =
  await >>= fun a ->
    if pred a then yield a >> filter pred
    else filter pred

(* Compute the sum of all odd integers up to 1000000. *)
assert (iota 1000000 => filter odd => fold (+) 0 = 250000000000);

(* Take 5 integers from an infinit sequence and collect them into a list. *)
assert (count => take 5 => collect = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]);
```
